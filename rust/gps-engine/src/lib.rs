//! A standalone GPS engine for track processing, route matching, and ghost
//! racing.
//!
//! The crate is intentionally pure and deterministic: the same input always
//! produces the same output, with no platform, network, or database
//! dependencies.
//!
//! The conceptual pipeline is:
//!
//! ```text
//! GPX → Track → process (filter / simplify / resample) → Route
//!     → Attempt → Performance → Ghost
//! ```
//!
//! Currently implemented: domain value types ([`units`]), the [`geo`]
//! primitives, the [`track`] model with construction-time validation and
//! processing, GPX input ([`gpx`]), synthetic generation ([`synthetic`]),
//! the [`route`] model with matching/discovery/canonicalization, the
//! [`attempt`] representation (GPS → route distance → elapsed time), and
//! race analysis ([`ghost`]).
